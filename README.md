# A class attendance system base on face recognition

This is my attempt to make a Face recognition system for classroom or attendance. <br>
The system is based on Baidu API.<br>
UI interface is Japanese.<br>
All functions have been integrated in face.py<br>
When the system is closed, a txt file consisting of attendance of all the students is generated.<br>
My level is limited. There may be bugs in the project. Welcome to propose solutions.<br>

# Put the face images in the./img/face
