# A class attendance system base on face recognition

This is my attempt to make a Face recognition system for classroom or attendance. 
The system is based on Baidu API.
UI interface is Japanese.
All functions have been integrated in face.py
When the system is closed, a txt file consisting of attendance of all the students is generated.
My level is limited. There may be bugs in the project. Welcome to propose solutions.
